# Predicting Online Shopping Revenue Using Classification

This project applies classification models to predict whether an online shopper will generate revenue, using web activity data. It helps e-commerce businesses better understand user behavior and personalize strategies to boost sales.

## 🎯 Objective
Develop machine learning models to classify online shoppers as revenue-generating or not based on behavioral features, enabling targeted marketing and UX optimization.

## ⚙️ Techniques
- Feature Selection
- Data Encoding & Scaling
- Chi-square and correlation-based filtering
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC


## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Outcome
The project achieved strong predictive performance with SVM but found logistic regression more scalable for large datasets. These models can help e-commerce sites personalize customer experiences and improve conversion rates.
